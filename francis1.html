    <h1>Francis Mukuha</h1>
    <p>I am a ambitious,self-made, work alcoholic but down to earth person. I like to balance professional & family life. Professional life gives you exposure, confidence & sense of achievement. I believe the fulfillment one gets from oneâ€™s work is very important for wellbeing.My motto in life is <em>"We only live once"</em>. I also participate in family get-togethers, functions, parties, etc. My favourite pastime is to watch action movies, reading novels & Farming.</p>
    <p>I learnt how to farm in my family farm in Meru county. Our farm is used for growing of both subsatial crops and cash crops</p>
